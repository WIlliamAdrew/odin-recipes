        <p>Lumpia Shanghai is a smaller, meatier type of egg roll that we Filipinos are very proud of!</p>
        <p> You could use pork, beef, or both. It's a very easy and yummy recipe that's great as finger food.</p>
        <p>We serve these spring rolls with sweet and sour sauce, soy sauce with lemon, or banana ketchup.</p>

            <li>1 medium onion, finely chopped</li>
            <li>1 carrot, grated</li>
            <li>1/4 cup soy sauce</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons salt</li>
            <li>1 1/2 tablespoons garlic powder</li>
            <li>2 1/2 teaspoons black pepper</li>
            <li>1 (16 ounce) package spring roll wrappers</li>
            <li>1/4 cup water, or as needed</li>
            <li>1 1/2 quarts oil for frying</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Combine ground pork, ground beef, onion, and carrot in a large bowl; mix well</p>
                <p>with hands. Gradually blend in soy sauce, salt, garlic powder, and pepper until</p>
                <p>incorporated.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Working one at a time, lay a wrapper on a flat surface with a corner pointing at</p>
                <p>you. Place about 2 tablespoons filling in a line, no thicker than your thumb,</p>
                <p>across the center of the wrapper. Moisten the edges of wrapper with water. Fold</p>
                <p>the bottom edge of wrapper snugly over filling. Fold in the left and right sides of</p>
                <p>wrapper towards the center. Roll up tightly to seal in filling.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Heat oil in a deep fryer or heavy skillet to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Working in batches, fry lumpia in hot oil, turning once, until golden brown, 3 to 4</p>
                <p>minutes. Drain on a paper towel-lined plate. Cut lumpia in half, or serve as-is</p>
                <p>with dipping sauce.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
